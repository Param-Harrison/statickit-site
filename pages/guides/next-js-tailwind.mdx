    "In this guide, you'll learn how to install Tailwind CSS in a Next.js project",
  path: '/guides/next-js-tailwind'
});

In this guide, we'll walk through how to install [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in a new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

Here's a working version of what you'll end up creating:

<BrowserDemo
  url="https://next-js-tailwind.levelhq.now.sh"
  label="next-js-tailwind.levelhq.now.sh"
/>

<StepHeading step="1">Create a new Next.js project</StepHeading>

Run the following command to create a fresh project:

```bash
npm create next-app next-js-tailwind
```

This command will make a new directory, add a `package.json` file with the necessary dependencies and script definitions, and scaffold a sample home page for you.

To boot up your local development server, run the following:

```bash
cd next-js-tailwind
npm run dev
```

You should see "Welcome to Next.js" when you open [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

<StepHeading step="2">Install dependencies</StepHeading>

Run the following to install Tailwind and its other dependencies:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss autoprefixer postcss-loader --save-dev
```

You'll also need to install the `next-css` plugin:

```bash
npm install @zeit/next-css
```

<StepHeading step="3">Configure the build pipeline</StepHeading>

Create a `postcss.config.js` file with the following:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss'),
    require('autoprefixer')
  ]
};
```

Then, create a `next.config.js` file and wrap your config with the `withCSS` function:

```js
const withCSS = require('@zeit/next-css');

module.exports = withCSS({});
```

This tells Next.js to process CSS files that you `import` in your code.

<StepHeading step="4">Add Tailwind to your CSS</StepHeading>

Create a CSS file in a `styles` directory and add the Tailwind directives:

```bash
mkdir styles && touch styles/main.css

cat >styles/main.css <<EOL
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
EOL
```

<StepHeading step="5">Import your CSS</StepHeading>

Open up `pages/index.js` and add your import:

```diff
  import React from 'react'
  import Link from 'next/link'
  import Head from 'next/head'
  import Nav from '../components/nav'
+
+ import '../styles/main.css'

  const Home = () => (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Home</title>
      </Head>
```

Eventually, you may wish to import your CSS in a [custom `<App>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs#custom-app) to ensure it gets loaded on every page.

You can now start using Tailwind CSS utilities in your `className` attributes!
