# Deployment

This document describes how to deploy your config to StaticKit.

## CLI

Run the following to install the CLI:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @statickit/cli
```

We recommend installing it locally with the `--save-dev` flag to ensure the command is available to run everywhere.

## Deploying

Your site's deploy key can be found under the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; tab in StaticKit.

```bash
npx statickit deploy -k <your-deploy-key>
```

Instead of using the `-k` flag every time, you can create a `.env` file in the root of your project and define an environment variable:

```bash
echo "STATICKIT_DEPLOY_KEY=<your-deploy-key>" >> .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

**Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.** You should treat your deploy key like any other secret token. A common convention is to create a `.env.example` file that developers can copy and populate on their local machine:

```bash
echo "STATICKIT_DEPLOY_KEY=" >> .env.example
```
