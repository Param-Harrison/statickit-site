# Deployment

Once you've created a `statickit.json` file, run the following to install the CLI and deploy:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @statickit/cli
npx statickit deploy -k <your-deploy-key>
```

Instead of using the `-k` flag every time, you can create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```bash
STATICKIT_DEPLOY_KEY=<your-deploy-key>
```

**Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.** You should treat your deploy key like any other secret token.
