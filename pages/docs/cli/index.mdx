# CLI

The StaticKit command line interface (CLI) comes with helpful commands for performing common tasks like adding a new form. You can use the CLI to make changes or edit your `statickit.json` file by hand â€” either way is fine!

## Installation

Install the command line interface with npm:

```bash
npm i -g @statickit/cli
```

## Add a form

Run the following command to add a new form to your config file.

```bash
statickit forms add <key> <name>
```

If you'd like to add extra functionality (like server-side validations and actions), you can edit the config manually.

</ArrowItem>

### Example 

The following command will change your `statickit.json` file like this:

```bash
statickit forms add contact-form "Contact Form"
```

```diff
  {
    "forms": {
+     "contact-form": {
+       "name": "Contact Form"
+     }
    }
  }
```

## Deploy

Once you are finished making changes to your local config file, you must deploy them to StaticKit with the CLI. 

```bash
statickit deploy -k <your-deploy-key>
```

Your site's deploy key can be found under the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; tab in StaticKit. Instead of using the `-k` flag every time, you can create a `.env` file in the root of your project and define an environment variable:

```bash
echo "STATICKIT_DEPLOY_KEY=<your-deploy-key>" >> .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

**Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.** You should treat your deploy key like any other secret token. A common convention is to create a `.env.example` file (excluding the actual key) that developers can use as a template:

```bash
echo "STATICKIT_DEPLOY_KEY=" >> .env.example
```
