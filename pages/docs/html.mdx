# HTML Library

The StaticKit HTML library is designed to be used in environments where you are crafting HTML by hand (as opposed to using something like React). If you are using a static site generator like **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, or **Middleman**, this is the library for you.

## Installation

If you don't have a modern JavaScript build pipeline in place, the CDN method is the quickest way to get up and running â€” just place our `<script>` tag anywhere on your page and instantiate your components inline:

```html
<script defer src="https://js.statickit.com/statickit.js"></script>

<script>
  window.sk=window.sk||function(){(sk.q=sk.q||[]).push(arguments)};

  // Put your StaticKit calls here
</script>
```

If you have a JavaScript build pipeline in place, it's best to install StaticKit as a dependency and `import` it in your JavaScript bundle:

```shell
npm i @statickit/standalone
```

```js
import sk from '@statickit/standalone'

// Put your StaticKit calls here
```

## Forms

The form component allows you to gather form submissions from your frontend without writing any backend code. 

Here's a working example of a contact form powered by StaticKit:

<div className="pb-6">
  <iframe width="100%" height="400" className="rounded-lg" src="//jsfiddle.net/StaticKit/5Lks2b6m/embedded/result,html,js/dark/" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Most other form endpoint services give you a URL to put in the `action` attribute and don't include any JavaScript. **We've intentionally taken a different approach.** 

We believe JavaScript-powered forms allow for a superior user experience:

- Validations errors can be rendered inline
- You can hook into our `on*` callbacks for tracking analytics
- You can render an inline post-submit message
- Form spam is less likely because there's not `action` to scrape
