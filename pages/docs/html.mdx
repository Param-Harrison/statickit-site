# HTML Library

The StaticKit HTML library is designed to be used in environments where you are crafting HTML by hand (as opposed to using something like React). If you are using a static site generator like **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, or **Middleman**, this is the library for you.

Here's a example of a working contact form powered by the StaticKit HTML library. Try it out!

<div className="pb-6">
  <iframe width="100%" height="400" className="rounded-lg" src="//jsfiddle.net/StaticKit/5Lks2b6m/embedded/result,html,js/dark/" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

## Installation

If you don't have a modern JavaScript build pipeline in place, the CDN method is the quickest way to get up and running â€” just place our `<script>` tag anywhere on your page and instantiate your components inline:

```html
<script defer src="https://js.statickit.com/statickit.js"></script>

<script>
  window.sk=window.sk||function(){(sk.q=sk.q||[]).push(arguments)};

  // Put your StaticKit calls here
</script>
```

If you have a JavaScript build pipeline in place, it's best to install StaticKit as a dependency and `import` it in your JavaScript bundle:

```shell
npm i @statickit/standalone
```

```js
import sk from '@statickit/standalone'

// Put your StaticKit calls here
```
