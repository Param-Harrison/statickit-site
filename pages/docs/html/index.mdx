# HTML Library

The StaticKit HTML library is designed for environments where you are authoring plain HTML (instead a framework like React). If you are using a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Middleman, this is the library for you.

## Installation

The CDN method is the quickest way to get up and running. 

Just place our `<script>` tag anywhere on your page:

```html
<script defer src="https://js.statickit.com/statickit.js"></script>

<script>
  window.sk=window.sk||function(){(sk.q=sk.q||[]).push(arguments)};

  sk('form', 'init', { 
    // ...
  });
</script>
```

Note that our script is loaded asynchronously, so it will never impact your site's performance.

If you have a modern JavaScript pipeline in place, it's best to install StaticKit as a dependency:

```shell
npm install @statickit/html
```

In your JavaScript file:

```js
import sk from '@statickit/html'

sk('form', 'init', { 
  // ...
});
```
