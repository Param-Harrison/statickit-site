# HTML Library

The StaticKit HTML library is designed for environments where you are authoring plain HTML (instead a framework like React). If you are using a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Middleman, this is the library for you.

## Installation

The CDN method is the quickest way to get up and running. Just place our `<script>` tag anywhere on your page:
