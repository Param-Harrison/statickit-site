# HTML Forms

The form component gathers and stores HTML `<form>` submissions for you. Under the covers, it works by attaching to the `submit` event and posting the form data to our servers.

For optimal user experience, StaticKit forms are powered by JavaScript — no `action` attribute necessary. This allows us to do things like render validation errors inline and swap out the form with a success message upon submission.

## Getting started

At a minimum, you just need a `<form>` element on your page and an `init` call:

```html
<form id="#my-form">
  <!-- your fields here -->
</form>
```

```js
sk('form', 'init', {
  id: '[...]' 
  element: '#my-form'
});
```

The `id` is the form ID provided by StaticKit (e.g. `f53fe2faa75d`) and the `element` is a DOM selector targeting the `<form>` node. There are more config options documented below.

Here is a working example of an opt-in form. Try it out!

<div className="pb-6">
  <iframe width="100%" height="300" className="rounded-lg" src="//jsfiddle.net/StaticKit/L2hx61cy/embedded/result,html,js/dark/" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

You'll notice that we are overriding the `onSuccess` callback to replace the form with a custom message — we'll learn about that next.

## Handling success

The most common thing you’ll want to customize is the behavior after the form is submitted. By default, the `<form>` element gets replaced with an unstyled “Thank you!” `<div>` element.

Here's an example config that replaces the form with a custom message:

```js
sk('form', 'init', {
  id: '[...]',
  element: '#my-form',
  onSuccess: function(config) {
    var h = config.h;
    var form = config.form;
    var replacement = h('div.success-message', 'Thank you for joining!');
    form.parentNode.replaceChild(replacement, form);
  }
});
```

Let's step through what's happening here:

- `config.h` is a simple helper for creating DOM nodes called [HyperScript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript)
- `config.form` is a reference to the `<form>` element
- `replacement` is new element to swap in for the `<form>`
- The last line does the actual DOM node replacement

If you want to redirect to a different page, you can do that instead:

```js
sk('form', 'init', {
  id: '[...]',
  element: '#my-form',
  onSuccess: function(config) {
    window.location.href = '/thank-you';
  }
});
```

## Handling errors

Most of the time, it will be sufficient to use standard HTML validation attributes to prevent bad submissions, such as the `required` attribute. But you can optionally configure server-side validations to ensure bad data does not slip through.

When validation errors occur, the client library will look for an element with a `data-sk-error` attribute and populate it with validation errors for the corresponding field:

```diff
  <form id="my-form">
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input id="email" type="email" name="email" value="" />
+   <div data-sk-error="email" class="error-message"></div>
    <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
  </form>
```

## Programmatic fields

If you need to set some fields programmatically, you can define them in the `data` config.

```js
// This will append a `userAgent` field to the form data
sk('form', 'init', {
  id: '[...]',
  element: '#my-form',
  data: {
    userAgent: navigator.userAgent
  }
});
```

The `data` object values can be either static values or functions (that will be evaluated at submission time):

```js
sk('form', 'init', {
  id: '[...]',
  element: '#my-form'
  data: {
    pageTitle: function() {
      return document.title;
    }
  }
});
```

## Email subject and reply-to

If you have an email notifications configured for your form, you can customize the subject line and reply-to address using special fields:

- `_subject`
- `email` or `_replyto`

You may add `<input>` fields to your form to make these settable by the user, or set them programmatically:

```js
sk('form', 'init', {
  id: '[...]',
  element: '#my-form',
  data: {
    _subject: 'New contact submission'
  }
});
```
