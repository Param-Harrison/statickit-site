# Introduction

StaticKit is a toolkit for creating powerful web forms. To get started, run the following commands to install the StaticKit command line interface and initialize your project:

```bash
npm i -g @statickit/cli
statickit init
```

This will create an empty `statickit.json` file in the root of your project. This is where you will configure your forms. To apply the changes you make to your `statickit.json` file, run the deploy command:

```bash
statickit deploy -k {your-deploy-key}
```
