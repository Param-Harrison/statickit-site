# Introduction

StaticKit is the modern way to gather form submissions from your website.

## Client Libraries

We have a few client libraries for different environments:

- [HTML](/docs/html): Great for environments where you are authoring plain HTML.
- [React](/docs/react): Great for environments where React is available for rendering.
