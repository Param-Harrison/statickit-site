# Introduction

StaticKit is a toolkit for creating powerful web forms. To get started, run the following commands to install the StaticKit command line interface and initialize your project:

```bash
npm i -g @statickit/cli
statickit init
```

## How It Works

StaticKit provides backend functionality by way of JavaScript functions. Suppose you are building a contact form and you would like to receive an email when it gets submitted. To do this, you can create a `sendContactEmail` function in your `statickit.json` file:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "sendContactEmail": {
      "type": "sendNotification",
      "to": "{your-email-address}"
    }
  }
}
```

When you deploy this config to StaticKit, we'll install a `@statickit/functions` npm package with your function definition. Then, you can call your `sendContactEmail` function in your JavaScript code:

```js highlight=11,12,13,14,15,16,17
import { createClient, sendContactEmail } from '@statickit/functions';

const client = createClient({ site: '{your-site-id}' });
const form = document.getElementById('myForm');

form.addEventListener('submit', async function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  let data = new FormData(form);

  await sendContactEmail(client, {
    subject: 'New contact submission',
    fields: {
      email: data.get('email'),
      message: data.get('message')
    }
  });
});
```

That's it! You are free to mix and match different StaticKit function types to make your forms behave exactly how you need. [Learn more about function types &rarr;](/docs/functions)
