# Introduction

StaticKit is the modern way to gather form submissions from your frontend without writing a line of backend code. It works great with React-based generators, like Next.js and Gatsby, and traditional HTML-based generators, like Jekyll and Hugo.

## Configuration

StaticKit sites are configured with a `statickit.json` file and provisioned with a `deploy` command. This has some important advantages:

- Your config lives in version control
- You can see your whole config at glance (instead of clicking though a UI)
- You can atomically deploy your config during your build process
- You can easily replicate your config in local, staging, and production environments

```js
{
  "forms": {
    "contact": {
      "name": "Contact Form"
    }
  }
}
```

## Client Libraries

We have a few client libraries for wiring up StaticKit resources on the frontend. The HTML library is great for environments where you are authoring plain HTML. If you are using React (e.g. Gatsby or Next.js), then the React library is what you need.
