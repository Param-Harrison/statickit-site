# Getting Started

StaticKit is the modern way to gather form submissions from your static site. It works great with React-based generators, like Next.js and Gatsby, and traditional HTML-based generators, like Jekyll and Hugo.

## Configuration

StaticKit sites are configured with a `statickit.json` file (in the root of your project directory) and deployed from the command line. 

For example, this config tells StaticKit that a &ldquo;Contact Form&rdquo; should exist and that you should receive a notification email after submission: 

```js
{
  "forms": {
    "contact": {
      "name": "Contact Form",
      "actions": {
        "email": [{
          "to": "<your-email-address>"
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

Once you've created a `statickit.json` file, run the following to install the CLI and deploy it. Your deploy key can be found in your site "Settings" tab.

```bash
npm i --save-dev @statickit/cli
npx statickit deploy -k <your-deploy-key>
```

## Client Libraries

Use the client library that fits your needs to wire up your StaticKit resources on the front-end.

## FAQ

### Why use a config file instead of a web interface?

The `statickit.json` config approach has several key advantages:

- You can commit your config in version control
- You can see everything at glance (instead of clicking though a UI)
- You can deploy your changes during your build process
- You can replicate the same config in local, staging, and production environments
