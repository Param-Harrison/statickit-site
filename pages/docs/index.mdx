# Introduction

StaticKit is the modern way to gather form submissions from your frontend without writing a line of backend code. It works great with React-based generators, like Next.js and Gatsby, and traditional HTML-based generators, like Jekyll and Hugo.

## Configuration

StaticKit sites are configured with a `statickit.json` file and deployed from the command line. The following config will create a form called &ldquo;Contact Form&rdquo; that notifies you via email. 

Try it out by creating a `statickit.json` file in the root of your project!

```js
{
  "forms": {
    "contact": {
      "name": "Contact Form",
      "actions": {
        "email": [{
          "to": "<your-email-address>"
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

Once you've created a `statickit.json` file, run the following to install the CLI and deploy:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @statickit/cli
npx statickit deploy -k <your-deploy-key>
```

## FAQ

### Why a config file instead of a web interface?

The `statickit.json` config approach has several key advantages:

- You can commit your config in version control
- You can see everything at glance (instead of clicking though a UI)
- You can deploy your changes during your build process
- You can replicate the same config in local, staging, and production environments
