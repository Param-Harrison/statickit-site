# Introduction

StaticKit provides zero-code serverless functions for front-end developers. Sites are configured via a `statickit.json` file that lives in your repository (alongside your website code) and deployed from the command line.

## Installation

From your project directory, run the following to initialize your project:

```bash
npm i -g @statickit/cli
statickit init
```

This will create a bare `statickit.json` file â€” you should keep this file in source control.

## Create a function

Open up your `statickit.json` file and replace it with the following:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "helloWorld": {
      "type": "sendNotification",
      "to": "{your-email-address}"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, deploy your changes to StaticKit:

```bash
statickit deploy -k <your-deploy-key>
```

This will install the `@statickit/functions` package in your project.

## Make a call

On your front-end, import your `helloWorld` function and call it somewhere:

```js
import { helloWorld, createClient } from '@statickit/functions';
let client = createClient({ site: "{your-site-id}" });

helloWorld(client, { subject: "Hello world!" });
```

You should have received an email! Congratulations, you are off to the races. We have a growing collection function types to help with your server-side needs.
