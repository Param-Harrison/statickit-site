# Introduction

StaticKit is the modern way to gather form submissions from your website.

<div className="pb-6">
  <iframe width="100%" height="400" className="rounded-lg" src="//jsfiddle.net/StaticKit/5Lks2b6m/embedded/result,html,js/dark/" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

## Client Libraries

We have a few client libraries for different environments:

- [HTML](/docs/html) for when you are authoring plain HTML.
- [React](/docs/react) for when React is available for rendering.
