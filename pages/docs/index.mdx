# Introduction

StaticKit is the modern way to gather form submissions from your frontend without writing a line of backend code. It works great with React-based generators, like Next.js and Gatsby, and traditional HTML-based generators, like Jekyll and Hugo.

## Deployment

Configure the resources you need in a `statickit.json` file and deploy via the command line (instead of a traditional web interface). This allows you to check your configuration into source control and deploy changes during your build process.

```js
{
  "forms": {
    "contact": {
      "name": "Contact Form"
    }
  }
}
```

## Client Libraries

We have a few client libraries for wiring up StaticKit resources on the frontend. The HTML library is great for environments where you are authoring plain HTML. If you are using React (e.g. Gatsby or Next.js), then the React library is what you need.
