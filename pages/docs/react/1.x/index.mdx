# React Library

_Versions_: **1.x** | [2.x](/docs/react)

The StaticKit React library provides helpful hooks for interfacing with the StaticKit backend. It works great with frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby, and is fully compatible with server-side prerendering.

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/unstacked/statickit-react/tree/v1.x) | [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statickit/react)

## Installation

Run the following to install the package:

```bash
npm install @statickit/react
```

This library assumes that React is already installed in your environment as a peer dependency. Our helpers rely on [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), so **you must be on version 16.8.0 or higher**.
