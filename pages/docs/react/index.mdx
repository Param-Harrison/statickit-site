# React Library

The StaticKit React library works great with static site generators like **Next.js** and **Gatsby** and custom React applications. If you don't have React in your toolchain, check out our [HTML library](/docs/html) instead. 

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/unstacked/statickit-react) | [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statickit/react)

## Installation

Run the following to install the package:

```bash
npm install @statickit/react
```

This library assumes that React is already installed in your environment. Our components are built with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), so **you must be on version 16.8.0 or higher**.
