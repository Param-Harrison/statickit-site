# React Library

The StaticKit React library provides helpful hooks for interfacing with the StaticKit backend. It works great with frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, and create-react-app, and is fully compatible with server-side prerendering.

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/unstacked/statickit-react) | [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statickit/react)

## Installation

Run the following to install the package:

```bash
npm install @statickit/react
```

This library assumes that React is already installed in your environment as a peer dependency. Our helpers rely on [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), so **you must be on version 16.8.0 or higher**.

## Context

The hooks in this library expect you to place the `<StaticKitProvider>` in your top-level app or layout component. Under the covers, this component instantiates an instance of the StaticKit client and makes it available to child components via the `useStaticKit` hook.

Here's an example of a custom Next.js app file:

```jsx
import { StaticKitProvider } from '@statickit/react';

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <StaticKitProvider site="{your-site-id}">
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </StaticKitProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Version Note**: `<StaticKitProvider>` was introduced in version 2.0 of the React library. If you are on version 1.x, [head here for the docs &rarr;](/docs/react/1.x/use-form)
