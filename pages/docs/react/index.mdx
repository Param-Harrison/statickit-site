# React Library

TODO: Write intro

## Installation

Run the following to install via npm:

```bash
npm install @statickit/react
```

This package assumes that you already have React available as a dependency. Since we use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), you must be on React >= 16.8.0.
