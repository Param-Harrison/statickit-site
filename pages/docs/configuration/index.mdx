# Configuration

StaticKit sites are configured with a `statickit.json` file and deployed via the command line interface (CLI). To get started, install the CLI in your project:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @statickit/cli
```

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/unstacked/statickit-cli) | [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statickit/cli)

Here's an example of a `statickit.json` file. This site has a contact form with a couple required fields and an action to send a notification to john@example.com when someone submits it.

```js
{
  "forms": {
    "contact": {
      "name": "Contact Form",
      "fields": {
        "email": {
          "type": "email",
          "prettyName": "Email address",
          "required": true
        },
        "message": {
          "type": "text",
          "prettyName": "Message",
          "required": true
        }
      },
      "actions": {
        "email": [{
          "to": "john@example.com" 
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

Once you have a `statickit.json` file, replace `<your-deploy-key>` with your actual key and run the following command:

```bash
STATICKIT_DEPLOY_KEY=<your-deploy-key> npx statickit deploy
```

For deploying locally, the CLI will load environment variables from your project `.env` file (if one exists).

**Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.** Instead, add your deploy key to your build platform as a (secret) environment variable. Below are instructions on how to do this on commonly used platforms. 

### ZEIT Now

First, add your deploy key to your `now` secrets:

```bash
now secrets add statickit-deploy-key <your-deploy-key>
```

Then, in your `now.json` file, provide the build script with the environment variable:

```js
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "STATICKIT_DEPLOY_KEY": "@statickit-deploy-key"
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, add StaticKit deployment to your `now-build` script in `package.json`:

```diff
  {
    "scripts": {
-     "now-build": "your-build-script"
+     "now-build": "your-build-script && statickit deploy"
    }
  }
```
